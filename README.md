# Environment

...

## Installation

To add Environment as a local, per-project dependency to your project, simply add a dependency on `sebastian/environment` to your project's `composer.json` file. Here is a minimal example of a `composer.json` file that just defines a dependency on Environment 1.0:

    {
        "require": {
            "sebastian/environment": "1.0.*"
        }
    }

## Usage

```php
<?php
```
